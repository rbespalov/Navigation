                description: "Soundtrack to Your Escape is the seventh studio album of Swedish metal band In Flames, released on 29 March 2004. The album was criticized by longtime fans because of a major change in musical style. However, the album was seen by many as a natural progression from Reroute to Remain and was critically praised by critics such as Metal Hammer and Kerrang!. It reached number 3 in Sweden, number 45 on the American Billboard 200 chart (the band's first album to reach the Billboard 200), number 2 on the Top Heatseekers chart, and number 7 on the Independent Albums chart.",

                description: "Conspiracy of One is the sixth studio album by American rock band the Offspring, released on November 14, 2000, by Columbia Records. By the time of its release, the band had come out in support of peer-to-peer file sharing, claiming it would not hurt sales. Conspiracy of One was originally planned to be released directly on their website before retail, until Columbia Records threatened to sue and the album ended up as a physical release. The album was the last to feature drummer Ron Welty, who left the band in early 2003 to pursue his career with Steady Ground.",
